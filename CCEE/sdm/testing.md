# Application Testing

1. What is testing?

   - process of evaluating a system or component to find whether it satisfies the SRS or not.
   - executing a system in order to identify any gaps, or missing requirements in contrary to the actual requirements.
   - Testing will be done by
     - Software Developer
     - Software Tester
     - Project/Lead Manager
     - End User

2. When to start testing?

   - (Requirement Gathering phase) analysis and verification of requirements.
   - (Designing) Reviewing the design with intent to improve design.
   - Unit Testing (By developer at completion of code.)

3. When to Stop Testing?

   - Testing deadlines
   - completion of test case execution
   - completion of functional and code coverage to a certain point.
   - bug rate falls below a certain level and no-high priority bugs are identified.
   - Management decision

4. Verification(developers) vs Validation(testers)

   - Addresses the concern: "Are you building it right?"
     "Are you building the right thing?"

   - Ensure that the software system meets all the functionality.  
     Ensures that the functionalities meet the intended behavior.
   - Takes place first and includes the checking for documentation, code.
     Validation occurs after verification and mainly involves the checking of overall product.

   - Done by developers vs Done by testers
   - has static activities: collecting reviews,
     walkthroughs, inspection to verify a software.
     has dynamic activities: executing software against the requirements.
   - objective process and no subjective decision should be needed to verify a software
     subjective process and involves subjective decisions on how well a software works.

5. Quality Assurance vs Quality Control
   - QA include
