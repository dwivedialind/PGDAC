1. Source: Exchanges, Market Vendors - because they have structured data
2. Data Format: CSV - easy to utilise
3. Data Reception: HFT system establish connection to data sources and continously receive data streams
2. Parsing: The received data needs to be parsed to extract relevant information like:
i. instrument identifiers(stock symbols)
ii.Bid/ask prices
iii. Order book depth(number of buy and sell orders at different price levels)
iv. Trade details(quantity, price, temstamp)
3. Validation and cleaning: Data might contain errors and inconsistencies. HFT systems must implement checks to ensure data integrity and filter out any invalid information.
4. Normalization: Data from different sources might have varying formats or units Normalization ensures consistent representation for further processing and analysis
5. Data Storage: Processed data is often stored in low-latency data structure like:
Ring Buffer : circular buffers that allow efficient addtion and removal of data elements, minimizing latency.
HashTables: Enable fast retrieval of specific data points based on keys.
6. Dissemination: Processed data is made available to other components of the HFT system, such as the the order generation and execution module or the algorithmic trading strategy engine.

Steps: I am going to perform:
1. Source: where I can get some structured data.
2. Data Format: convert the format to CSV.
3. Data Reception: establish connection to data sources to continously receive data streams.


1. Type of data I am getting: Symbol:
AAPL (Apple Inc.)
Timestamp: 2024-03-16 15:10:00.001
Bid Price: $150.25 -- it represents the highest price that a buyer is currently willing to pay for one share of AAPL stock. It essentially reflects the current demand for the stock.
Ask Price: $150.30 -- This represents the lowest price that a seller is currently willing to accept for one share of AAPL stock. It reflects the current supply of the stock.
Volume: 100 shares: This indicates the number of shares of AAPL stock that have been traded at the given bid and ask prices withing a specific timeframe This data point reflects the trading activity for the stock. 

A transaction(trade) occurs only if a buyer's bid price meets or exceeds a seller's ask price. 
HFT systems constantly monitor these data points to identify potential trading opportunities based on price movements, order book depth and volume changes.
