Drawbacks of Complex Inheritance Hierarchies:
While inheritance offers benefits, complex hierarchies with many levels or intricate relationships can lead to several drawbacks:

Difficulty in Maintaining:
Changes in a high-level base class can have cascading effects on numerous derived classes, requiring widespread modifications and testing.
Debugging issues becomes challenging as errors might originate from unexpected parts of the hierarchy.
Reduced Readability:
Code can become harder to understand as the relationships between classes become intricate.
Developers might need to navigate through multiple layers of inheritance to grasp the complete behavior of a class.
Tight Coupling:
Derived classes become highly dependent on the implementation details of base classes, limiting flexibility for future changes.
Modifying a base class can break derived classes if they rely on specific behaviors.
The "Fragile Base Class" Problem:
If a base class becomes unstable with frequent changes, all derived classes inherit these changes and might become unstable as well.
The "Diamond Problem" (Multiple Inheritance):
With multiple inheritance, if two base classes have the same method name, a derived class can inherit conflicting implementations, leading to ambiguity about which method to call.


Strategies to Manage Complexity:
Here are strategies to mitigate the drawbacks of complex inheritance hierarchies:

Favor Composition over Inheritance for "Has-A" Relationships:
Use composition when a class "has-a" dependency on another class (e.g., Document has-a Text object). This creates a looser coupling between classes.
Utilize Interfaces:
Define interfaces that specify behavior without implementation details. Classes can implement these interfaces, promoting code reuse and decoupling implementation from inheritance.
Break Down Large Hierarchies:
If a hierarchy becomes too complex, consider refactoring it into smaller, more manageable hierarchies. This can improve code organization and maintainability.
Use Dependency Injection:
Inject dependencies (objects needed by a class) through constructors or setter methods. This allows for more flexible testing and reduces coupling between classes.
Favor Single Inheritance When Possible:
While multiple inheritance can be useful in specific scenarios, using single inheritance generally leads to simpler and more maintainable code structures
