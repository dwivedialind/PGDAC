1. Unique Constraint:
i. table level & also column level constraint.
ii. there is no limit on no. of unique constraints on table.
iii. duplicate values are not allowed.
iv. null values are allowed (null values are treated differently).can enter any number of null values.
v. unique indexes are created automatically.
vi. Text and Blob can not have unique constraint.
vii. can combine upto 32 columns in composite unique. 
viii. Unique constraint is also an index so to drop it use
drop index mob_no on emp;

ix. constraint name is optional(try to give meaningful names)
alter table employee add constraint u_emp_ename unique(ename);

2. Column level constraint can be specified at table level except 'not null' constraint, which is column level constraint hence syntax will not support you from specifying at table level.
But a table level composite constraint cannot be specified at column level.

3. Foreign Key constraint:
i. Foreign column, or set of columns that references a column or set of columns of some table.
foreign key constraint is specified on chile column(not the parent column).
ii. The parent column, it has to be primary key or unique.
iii. Foreign key will allow duplicate values unless specified otherwise, will allow null values unless specified otherwise.
iv. foreign key may reference column of same table also known as self-referencing.
