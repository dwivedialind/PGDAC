Impedance Mismatch:

Impedance mismatch, in computer science, occurs when two systems trying to communicate have incompatible ways of representing or exchanging data. This can be like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, leading to errors or inefficiencies.

For example, imagine an online store (system 1) uses a database that stores product information in objects with details like name, price, and stock. But their payment gateway (system 2) expects a flat file with just product IDs and prices. Converting between these formats creates an impedance mismatch.
